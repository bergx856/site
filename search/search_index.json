Within this project I documented my journey of becoming digitally literate, and also created a map of my personal learning network via Coggle. Static Site The second project that I completed within this course was the first version of my static site. I was initially quite daunted with this project as it was my first experience ever coding in HTML and with Atom, but ultimately I had a lot of fun. In comparison to the Google Site, there was a newfound ability to customize to my heart's content - which was very exciting for me. This project provided an excellent foundation of basic coding knowledge for me to build upon as the semester progressed. Client Project The third project that I completed within this course was for a client, Daphne of the Minnesota Austin Healey Club (MNAHC). Within this project, my classmates and I worked to redevelop a more functional site for the MNAHC. I specifically worked on the \"resources\" section of the website, whose content remained quite similar to the current site . The site was created in WordPress, which was another program that I was completely unfamiliar with. I found it relatively easy to use, and it was incredibly gratifying to see the full site come together when we finished.
