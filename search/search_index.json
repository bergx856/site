My name is Sara Berg, and I'm currently a senior at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I am a Technical Writing and Communications major with an emphasis in Environmental Science, as well as a minor in Sustainability Studies. I will be graduating this fall, and can't wait to see what's next for me after receiving my bachelor's! I'm incredibly passionate about living sustainably and consciously, and encouraging others to do so. Some of my hobbies include pc gaming, thrifting, reading, and listening to music. Some of my favorite games right now are Genshin Impact, League of Legends, and Overwatch. The last book that I read was Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler, which I would highly recommend to those interested in science fiction. Some of my favorite musicians right now are Porter Robinson , STAYC , and spill tab .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-my-site","text":"this site was created as my final project for WRIT4662W (\uff89\u25cf\u02d8\u25e1\u02d8\u25cf)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727","title":"Welcome to My Site"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"Hello, World!

Within this project I documented my journey of becoming digitally literate, and also created a map of my personal learning network via Coggle. Static Site The second project that I completed within this course was the first version of my static site. I was initially quite daunted with this project as it was my first experience ever coding in HTML and with Atom, but ultimately I had a lot of fun. In comparison to Google Sites, there was a newfound ability to customize to my heart's content - which was very exciting for me. This project provided an excellent foundation of basic coding knowledge for me to build upon as the semester progressed. Client Project The third project that I completed within this course was for a client, Daphne of the Minnesota Austin Healey Club (MNAHC). Within this project, my classmates and I worked to redevelop a more functional site for the MNAHC. I specifically worked on the \"resources\" section of the website, whose content remained quite similar to the current site . The site was created in WordPress, which was another program that I was completely unfamiliar with. I found it relatively easy to use, and it was incredibly gratifying to see the full site come together when we finished. DITA Site The fourth project that I completed within this course was structured authoring with DITA. It was created in Oxygen XML Editor, and our final products were a website and a PDF file. I wasn't particularly fond of using Oxygen XML, but I plan to look into other methods of developing DITA content in the future! Creation of this Site The fifth and final project that I completed within this course was creating a MkDocs site, which is what you're seeing right now! To read more about the site's technical conception, visit the page entitled \"Markdown\". Course Reflection As a final conclusion and a fond farewell, I reflected upon my growth within and what's to come after this course. I hope you enjoy.","title":"Coursework"},{"location":"coursework/#writ4662w-coursework","text":"","title":"WRIT4662W Coursework"},{"location":"coursework/#digital-literacy-narrative","text":"The first project that I completed within this course was a Digital Literacy Narrative, which was presented via Google Sites.
